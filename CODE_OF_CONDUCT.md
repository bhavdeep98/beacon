## Special Considerations for Mental Health Work

Given our focus on mental health support for minors:

**Sensitivity Required**
- Discussions about mental health must be respectful and evidence-based
- Avoid stigmatizing language or assumptions
- Recognize that contributors may have personal experiences with mental health challenges
- Use content warnings when discussing crisis scenarios or self-harm

**Data Protection**
- Never share, discuss, or reference actual student data in public forums
- Use synthetic test data only
- Report any accidental data exposure immediately
- Follow all FERPA, COPPA, and privacy guidelines

**Crisis Response**
- If a contributor expresses thoughts of self-harm or suicide, take it seriously
- Contact project leadership immediately
- Provide crisis resources (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in USA)
- Do not attempt to provide counseling—connect them with professionals
